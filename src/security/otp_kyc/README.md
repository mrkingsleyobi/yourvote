# OTP/KYC Authentication Service

## Overview
This module implements the OTP and KYC authentication services for the AI-Native Election Voting System.

## Features
- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) generation and validation
- Multi-factor authentication support
- KYC document verification
- Biometric verification integration
- Secure storage of authentication data
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Implementation Plan

This file will contain the implementation of:
1. TOTPService class for OTP generation and validation
2. KYCVerificationService class for identity verification
3. EnhancedAuthenticationAgent class that integrates with the DAA framework
4. Secure storage mechanisms for authentication secrets
5. Rate limiting and security measures

## Integration Points
- DAA Authentication Agents
- Quantum-resistant cryptography (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA)
- Government database APIs for identity verification
- Biometric verification services
- SMS/Email services for OTP delivery

## Security Considerations
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Immutable audit trails for authentication events
- Protection against brute force and replay attacks
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and election security standards
