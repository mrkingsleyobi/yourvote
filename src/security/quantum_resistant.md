  }
  
  async establishSecureChannel(peer) {
    // Key encapsulation
    const { cipherText, sharedSecret } = await this.mlKEM.encap(peer.publicKey);
    
    // Channel authentication
    const signature = await this.mlDSA.sign(cipherText, this.privateKey);
    
    return { cipherText, signature, sharedSecret };
  }
  
  async verifyAndDecap(cipherText, signature, peerPublicKey) {
    // Verify authenticity
    const isValid = await this.mlDSA.verify(cipherText, signature, peerPublicKey);
    if (!isValid) throw new Error("Invalid signature");
    
    // Decapsulate shared secret
    return await this.mlKEM.decap(cipherText, this.privateKey);
