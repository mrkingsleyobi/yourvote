# DAA Framework Architecture Specification

## Overview
This document specifies the technical architecture for the Decentralized Autonomous Agents (DAA) framework within the AI-Native Election Voting System.

## Core Components

### Agent Layer
- Registration Agents
- Authentication Agents
- Ballot Agents
- Validation Agents
- Tabulation Agents
- Audit Agents

### Coordination Layer
Implementation of the M-R-A-R-A loop:
1. Monitor - Real-time system observation
2. Reason - Data analysis and decision making
3. Act - Implementation of decisions
4. Reflect - Performance evaluation
5. Adapt - Continuous improvement

### Communication Layer
- Post-quantum cryptographic protocols
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) messaging
- QR-Avalanche consensus algorithm
- Anonymous onion routing for privacy

### Security Layer
- Quantum-resistant cryptography (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for ballot secrecy
- Continuous threat monitoring
- Immutable audit trails

## Technical Requirements

### Agent Lifecycle Management
- Dynamic agent creation and termination
- Resource allocation and deallocation
- Health monitoring and failure recovery
- Version control and update mechanisms

### Agent Communication Protocol
- Standardized message formats
- Secure channel establishment
- Message queuing for asynchronous processing
- Broadcast and multicast capabilities

### Data Management
- Distributed storage with redundancy
- Immutable ledger for audit trails
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Efficient data retrieval mechanisms
