# Economic Model with Token-Based Incentives

## Overview
This document specifies the economic model for the DAA-based voting system using token-based incentives to ensure economic self-sufficiency.

## Token System Design

### Voting Token (VOTE)
- Utility token for system operations
- Distributed to eligible voters during registration
- Used for voter authentication and ballot casting
- Burned after vote casting to prevent double voting

### Validation Token (VALID)
- Reward token for agent validation activities
- Distributed to agents for accurate processing
- Staked by agents to participate in validation
- Slashed for incorrect validation or malicious behavior

## Incentive Mechanisms

### Registration Incentives
- VALID tokens for successful voter registration
- Penalties for duplicate or fraudulent registrations

### Authentication Incentives
- VALID tokens for correct identity verification
- Penalties for false positives or negatives

### Validation Incentives
- VALID tokens for accurate vote validation
- Penalties for missed anomalies or false flags

### Tabulation Incentives
- VALID tokens for correct vote counting
- Penalties for calculation errors

### Audit Incentives
- VALID tokens for identifying system issues
- Rewards for security vulnerability discovery

## Resource Sharing Model

### Shared Resources
- Computational resources across the network
- Storage resources for audit trails
- Bandwidth for vote transmission
- Processing power for validation

### Cost Distribution
- Proportional cost sharing based on resource usage
- Transaction fees for system operations
- Staking requirements for agent participation
- Slashing penalties for malicious behavior

### Microtransaction Processing
- Low-cost operations for high-volume processing
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Gas-like mechanism for resource allocation
- Dynamic pricing based on network demand

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
contract TokenDistribution {
  mapping(address => uint256) public voteBalances;
  mapping(address => uint256) public validBalances;
  mapping(address => uint256) public stakedValid;
  
  function distributeVoteTokens(address voter) public {
    voteBalances[voter] += 1;
  }
  
  function distributeValidTokens(address agent, uint256 amount) public {
    validBalances[agent] += amount;
  }
  
  function stakeValidTokens(address agent, uint256 amount) public {
    require(validBalances[agent] >= amount);
    validBalances[agent] -= amount;
    stakedValid[agent] += amount;
  }
}
```

## Economic Security

### Slashing Conditions
- Incorrect validation results
- Failure to perform assigned tasks
- Malicious behavior or attacks
- Consensus violation

### Staking Requirements
- Minimum VALID tokens for agent participation
- Proportional staking based on responsibility level
- Time-locked staking for long-term commitment
- Delegation mechanisms for smaller participants

## Governance

### Token Holder Rights
- Voting on system parameter changes
- Proposal submission for improvements
- Validator selection and replacement
- Protocol upgrade approval

### Treasury Management
- Reserve funds for system maintenance
- Bug bounty programs
- Development fund allocation
- Emergency response funding
