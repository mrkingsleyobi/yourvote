# Repository Setup Summary

## Branching Strategy Implementation

We have successfully implemented the Git branching strategy for the AI-Native Election Voting System:

1. **Main Branches:**
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `develop`: Integration branch for ongoing development

2. **Supporting Branches:**
   - `feature/otp-service`: Feature branch for OTP service implementation
   - `release/v1.0.0`: Release branch for version 1.0.0
   - `hotfix/critical-security-patch`: Hotfix branch for critical security issues

## GitHub Issues and Labels

Created a comprehensive labeling system:
- Sprint labels (sprint-1-2 through sprint-23-24)
- Functional labels (security, authentication, ui-ux, testing, etc.)
- Created initial GitHub issues for key features from Sprint 1-2 and Sprint 3-4

## CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Established GitHub Actions workflows:
1. **ci-cd.yml**: Main CI/CD pipeline with testing, building, and deployment stages
2. **security-scan.yml**: Security scanning and CodeQL analysis
3. **code-quality.yml**: Code quality checks including linting and dependency checks
4. **testing.yml**: Comprehensive testing workflow with coverage reporting

## Documentation

Updated and created documentation:
- README.md with branching strategy and CI/CD information
- Workflow files with detailed configuration
- SECURITY_HOTFIX.md for hotfix documentation

## Next Steps

1. Review and merge PR #39 for the repository structure
2. Review and merge PR #40 for the critical security hotfix
3. Continue creating GitHub issues for remaining sprint tasks
4. Implement additional CI/CD pipeline enhancements
5. Set up branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings
